          I am currently in the third year of attaining my bachelor's degree.
          The ever-evolving nature of cyber security deeply fascinates me. I
          love learning about the new ways something/someone can be protected. I
          also like to write blog posts, which can include guides, reviews or
          anything I want to give my thoughts on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cyber security aside, I also love design and creation. I had ideas I
          wanted to bring to life and so I learned some web development as well.
          Hence the creation of this personal website. Moreover, when I was
          younger, I was briefly interested in graphic design. For 2 years, I
          sold several of my designs. These commissions included thumbnails,
          profile pictures and banner art.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I love reading books. I also like watching movies,
          playing video games and ranting about why Firefox is superior to
          Chromium based browsers.
