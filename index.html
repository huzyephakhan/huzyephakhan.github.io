          I am currently in the third year of attaining my bachelor's degree.
          The ever-evolving nature of cyber security deeply fascinates me. I
          love learning about the new ways something/someone can be protected. I
          also like to write blog posts, which can include guides, reviews or
          anything I want to give my thoughts on.

          Cyber security aside, I also love design and creation. When I was
          younger, I was briefly interested in graphic design. For 2 years, I
          sold serval of my designs. These commissions included thumbnails,
          profile pictures and banner art. Hence the creation of this personal
          website. I had ideas I wanted to bring to life and so I learned some web
          development as well.

          Outside of work, I love reading books. I also like watching movies,
          playing video games and ranting about why firefox is superior to
          chromium based browsers.
